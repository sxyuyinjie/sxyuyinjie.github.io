<!--Statement of Purpose-->
    <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
    <!--简历-->
    <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px">Born and bred in China, rarely did I feel the impact of macro-financial policy. In primary school’s math class, I was astounded at the difference that the rise of interest rate can cause. However, my parents and relatives seldom consider interest rate and the risk thereby while making housing or investing decisions. The common seems to be indifferent to the top-level macro policy. The childhood experience shaped my opinion about Chinese economy’s basic feature concerning both micro (like cautionary household saving) and macro mechanism (like the manipulation of stable interest rate). But not until college did I look in to the compelling difference and evolution of the economies and economic policies in China and America. Therefore, I’m applying for Harvard’s VUS program to broaden my horizon to American economy and exchange ideas concerning macro policy and institutional designs with the Harvard community. </p> <br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px">Macroeconomics is a discipline with infinite potential to explore. I’m not only obsessed to the elegant theorem but also the significance of practice which arouse my yearning to the position as a central bank officer. In fact, my interest in monetary policy is reinforced by recent phenomena in Chinese rising financial system and Geithner’s impressive book Pressure Test. Currently, China is on a trajectory of financial innovation but just as systematically risky and globally entangled as that of American before the crisis. Therefore, I plan to take International Financial and Macroeconomic Policy to learn more about macroeconomy from a global perspective. I also hope to learn important lessons from The Financial Crisis and the Great Recession about the origin and crux of the crisis. Besides, I’ve participated in three rural investigation and was impressed by the poverty and inequality. But I’m also confused about how unlikely are poor people benefited from financial policy. Fortunately, China is conducting inclusive finance thanks to fin-tech and trying to pinpoint where the money is most urgently needed. Therefore, I believe Inequality, Leverage, and Crises will benefit my understanding of the responsibility of monetary policy.</p> <br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px"> I’ve been trying to prepare myself for Harvard for the past years. I major in both economics and applied mathematics while learning computer science by auditing or myself to make myself technically competent. I took advantage of the techniques I’ve learned and joined in professor’s research as an assistant. I’ve assisted Prof. Victor Culture, from UC Berkeley, to establish a database and investigate the grass root’s living standard in China, meanwhile I assisted Prof. Huang at NSD in his research about macro-financial uncertainty. Now I’m trying to follow Prof. Nakamura form UC Berkeley and find measures to identify the impact of macro-policy, which is substantially more challenging but also closer to my ideal realm. </p><br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px"> I enjoy speculation. Back then in high school, I was deeply obsessed to math and spent two years on math competition. Though our school’s students hadn’t won the first prize for years, I made it in only Grade 11. In fact, I’m also ambitious and didn’t want the indulgence in math to isolate me from free thinking and non-academic interest. Fortunately, my encouraging family and school support me whenever I’m accompanying the choir on the piano from primary school to college, or organizing collective activities as the monitor of my class and minister of the Student Union. In fact, I was afraid of public speaking when I was a child. However, one important lesson that I learned from my parents is to jump out of comfort zone. And I’m always open to try new things, eager to learn more and challenge myself. I’m physically weak as a child. Under the company of my mother, I taught myself nearly all the sports I watched from TV, and built up an athletic figure. Now in college, I played in the PKU Cup for our department’s soccer team and I enjoyed learning from stronger opponents.</p> <br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px"> Given my admiration for Marxism, I believe that the world consists of unfettered men who have the capacity to develop all aspects of himself, is a dream of mankind. It’s also a dream of mine. And I believe Harvard is the right place to cultivate excellence and well-rounded humanity. Given my rigor academic training and experience outside the classroom, I believe I’m the right person that VUS program is expecting. With a strong desire to share ideas both inside and outside the classroom, I’m sincerely looking forward to join the Harvard community.</p> <br>

However, this course provided me a wider horizon to statistical approaches like beysian and ANOVA. And that encouraged me to learn simulation, which turns out worthwhile.  </td></tr>
