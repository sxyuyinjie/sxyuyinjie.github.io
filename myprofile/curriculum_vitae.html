<!--Statement of Purpose-->
    <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
    <!--简历-->
    <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px">There has been yet any statement so difficult to conceal excitement as one for Harvard, which for me is an institution
         original of inspirations and achievements and the place I’ll strive for however the exchange rate falls. I wasn’t exposed to the
          elegance of math until high school and regretted for not have explored the field of economics until college, 
          just as much as I’m grateful to hear about VUS program in days of confusion. However, math and economics, as well as the chance to go to Harvard, invokes 
          me from the very first moment of encounter to persistently pursue these ends. </p> <br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px"> One of my specific purpose is to exchange ideas with Harvard macroeconomics community. I’m concerned with Chinese economy from a perspective of macro-financial system. However, three experiences of rural area investigation render me confused about the extent to which the central bank’s policy influence the lives of the poor and deprived. As grass root common are much less sensible to interest rate than Finance Street’s businessman, and even ordinary American citizens to whom an increase in mortgage rate could damage their affordability. Therefore, I plan to choose three courses in Harvard concerning micro-financial policy and its impact on real economy, and bring my Chinese perspective to the class and the community. That’s also concurrent with my career plan to hold an office in some nation-level institution and engage myself in policy making.</p> <br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px">In the first two years of college, I drive myself to take double major in both economics and math. Besides economic theorem, I attached great important to statistics. With the belief that macroeconomics is an art combining reason and techniques, I spend lot of efforts learning stochastic theory, real analysis, mathematical statistics and computational approaches. I learned courses in computer and data science by myself and applied them to work for three professors as research assistant to gain experience in the practice of economic research. The experiences strengthen my belief that both intuition and technical measures are important to a great economist and motivate me to learn more. I also had a try in the financial industry in Soochow Sec Co., Ltd. However, I don’t think much of the macro analysis make sense and felt academical research much more interesting and meaningful. </p> <br>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px">Harvard is more than its prestigious academia and so does what make well-rounded personality. I feel lucky to grow up in a family and high school where non-academic interest was encouraged and supported. I spend my childhood in a free and blithe atmosphere, sleeping early at night and seldom doing extra curriculum work. I spend weekends teaching myself all the sports events I’d watched from TV and built up an athletic figure, while some kids may suffer from unwanted courses arranged by parents. I believe my initiative for completing tasks and yearning to learn was cultivated thereby. I’m also encouraged to choose the things I want learn. I never stopped playing piano no matter how busy I was during the past 12 years. I’m so obsessed that in college I still accompanied for the choir of our department and play duets with friends on the concert of the club. In fact, piano is one of my keys to keep energetic and social. I’d love to bring piano-adapted Chinese classical pieces to Harvard if given the chance.  </p> <br>

          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px"> I’m a person eager for challenge. I spared no effort for math competition though students in our high school havn’t won first prizes for many years. But I finally made it twice. I’m afraid of public speaking and leading people in the primary school. But I know I had to get out of my comfort zone. During my high school and college years, I’ve been the monitor in our class and the minister of academic department of the Student Union. We drew blackboard newspaper, organized debate competitions and reading party with collective effort. The experiences taught me great lesson to think for others and trying to figure out the most popular solution within limited resources and choices. I also appreciate the communication thereby which prevent the indulgence in math from taking me in isolation. I believe I’ll enjoy great social life in Harvard and hopefully offer and gain inspirations in collective activities.</p> <br>

          <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 300px"> In fact, macro policy and math, my two major focuses, are just the opposite in terms of the applicability within different situations. I’m therefore often confused by the frequent shifts from consistent speculation in math and the critical, condition-varying analysis of macro problems. But I’m happy to learn the most essential subject in natural and social science at the same time. Just as Alfred Marshall and Marx, two noble economists I admired most though would fight against each other both expressed and present by themselves, that a great economist, a naturally unfettered man, should develop himself in all aspects such as to be an artist, a mathematician, a politician, or may be a computer scientist nowadays. I believed that Harvard is the very place that can help me get closer to that goal. That’s why I’m committed to blaze my way to Harvard and looking forward to make a difference to the Harvard community both inside and outside the classroom.</p> <br>
